            <p>
                Toon van Berkel is a web developer and software-engineering enthusiast who enjoys
                building, fast websites, handy tools, and experiments. He mostly works with modern 
                JavaScript on the front end and simple Node/Express APIs on the back end, and he 
                tries to keep things accessible and performant.

                This site is a personal portfolio and notebook. Youâ€™ll find in-progress notes,
                front-end animations (GSAP), Raspberry&nbsp;Pi and electronics tinkering, and the
                occasional game prototype. Projects are updated as Toon learns and iterates.
